# reinforcement_Learning
I solved various Gymnasium API machine learning environments using Q-Learning, Monte Carlo, DQN, REINFORMENT, Actor-Critic reinforcment learning algorithms.

## Notes:
### monte_carlo_and_q-learning:
- Monte-Carlo algorithm is not working with MountainCar-v0 environment, not solved yet
- Q-learning is not working as intended. Not finding optimal policy regardless of how long it is run. it has been run for 10000 episode max. Cause unknown.
- Q-learning does work with MountainCar-v0 but does not seem to show the rewards properly for the rewards chart and the simulation ends too early.
